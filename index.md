In the next 20 years, not only robots and AI but augmented/virtual reality, digital fabrication, and other emerging tech will create an abundance of wealth. Today, most of the wealth created by emerging tech's completely bypasses communities from Compton to Harlan County. We have a once-in-a-century opportunity to change that.

Tech Craft is an exploration of a strategy for transforming the tech industry so that black, white, and brown workers from communities our society has written off can capture a big enough slice of emerging tech's wealth to be one pillar in helping to revitalize all of our communities.

{ A a few lines about what the strategy is -- similar to the concept of blue color coding jobs, only 1) including design as well as coding and 2) incorporating the best parts of the tradition of skilled craftspeople while come to terms with and overcoming the worst parts (e.g., locking up people based on race, ethnicity, and gender, claim to speak for society while abandoning low-paid workers).

It's about changing how we train. But it's also about
- Changing how we build the tools for creating tech
- Changing how we hire and what it takes to create co-ops and small businesses

It's definitely not the whole solution: it's not about opening up jobs that require a college degree or a PhD. And it assumes there are other efforts out there, like creating good-quality green jobs, that it's just one part of revitalize these communities.
