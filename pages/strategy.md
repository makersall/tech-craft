{ NOTE: right now, just a notes dump }

The real payoff is if we do a small amount of change in our direction now, as Emerging Tech takes over a bigger role in our lives, it will create more opportunities -- but only if we ensure black, white, and brown workers all have a shot at these new opportunities. Here's how:

## Tech
- Morph the tech to make Tech Craft easier to get into and Easier to work your way up
- We need to get smarter about how we build the languages, frameworks, and tools that are used for coding and design so that they are easier to get into -- not because this means everyone will be able to do this in a way that will get them a job, but that it makes it easier for folks to get into this field without going to college

2 types of tech craft jobs:
- where that's all what you doing
- where it's taking an existing non-tech job and expanding it out (i.e., domain expert plus techie skills)


## Training:
- The other place where we need experimentation is on continuous retraining, because over time work will go away
- How to make continual learning
  - Less scary
  - Less exhausting
- Exploring wealth-building in the community

## Hiring
- "Disrupt" the hiring? We need to get smarter, a.k.a. "disrupt" how people get into this field, so that more black, brown, and white folks from working-class communities have a shot
- Use a community-based approach to explore apprenticeships, etc. as ways of creating new openings
- Starting to nibble away at the edges by creating internships
- Looking at opportunities to promote pink collar workers from within, perhaps in a regional way


## Voice (Transform?)
- Craft that sees itself as plowing things back into the community
- How crafts survived before: racist guilds/unions to keep "supply" low
- How do we work this from the other end or another angle? (E.g., laws, "Leed certified", expand the niche market, create culture -- e.g., support your local artisan)
- We will have to fight for this: will only happen if we organize grassroots power to open this door & keep it open
- Unions and co-ops are a key part of this (leverage, power)
- Invest wealth into higher wages for what we value & need



## Making It Happen
So what can folks do about it?

### In Tech
- In tech: push in this direction
- This is also about creating clarity.
- Of going from the fuzzy "I'm going to democratize this technology" to talking much more clearly, okay, how exactly is this going to create more opportunities for folks who don't have a college degree in programming and aren't middle-class white males?
- And also saying much more clearly, we don't need to figure out right now how to scale huge,
but we do need to start at least thinking about that

### In Communities
- Start pushing tech to go in this direction, including experiments on a small scale, and start looking for building coalitions/whatever you would call it in regional communities to see if we can supply more jobs, and four rural areas get big tech companies to start making commitments to do pilot projects to see what's possible that are designed to create real jobs at the end for real small businesses or co-ops at the end.

### State Politicians
So what could a state politician do?

- They can act as a focus, of helping people convene
- and then looking forpots-of-money-to-underwrite the pilot projects that teach us enough to figure out where to go next
- If folks in a non-rural region where there are a bunch of tech jobs that aren't getting filled, could step back and ask, how do we experiment to see what's possible
- The goal isn't to get it right the first time, the goal is to take some steps forward

### Overall 
- In other words, don't pretend we can solve all of this right away.
- This is about creating new models and that means MVP's and iterating


### Potential Targets
- Ironically, one of the best places to start experimenting right now might be in analytics, with data analysts. It's not as sexy as machine learning, but there are a ton of places that still need it and the barriers to entry are smaller




### Miscellaneous
- Not what humans versus computers can do or "high skill" versus "low skill" but more/less common skill
- From cooking shows watched by folks who don't cook to local artisans who have live demo/performances and classes (also for folks who aren't super skilled but are good people)
