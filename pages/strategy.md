{ NOTE: right now, just a notes dump }

Here's how we can create opportunities for black, white, and brown workers in communities our society has left behind:

## Tech
- Morph the tech to make Tech Craft easier to get into and Easier to work your way up
- We need to get smarter about how we build the languages, frameworks, and tools that are used for coding and design so that they are easier to get into -- not because this means everyone will be able to do this in a way that will get them a job, but that it makes it easier for folks to get into this field without going to college

2 types of tech craft jobs:
- where that's all what you doing
- where it's taking an existing non-tech job and expanding it out (i.e., domain expert plus techie skills)


## Training:
- The other place where we need experimentation is on continuous retraining, because over time work will go away
- How to make continual learning
  - Less scary
  - Less exhausting
- Exploring wealth-building in the community

## Hiring
- "Disrupt" the hiring? We need to get smarter about how people get into emerging tech, so that more black, brown, and white folks from working-class communities have a shot
- Use a community-based approach to explore apprenticeships, etc. as ways of creating new openings
- Starting to nibble away at the edges by creating internships
- Looking at opportunities to promote pink collar workers from within, perhaps in a regional way


## Voice (Transform?)
- Craft that sees itself as plowing things back into the community
- How crafts survived before: racist guilds/unions to keep "supply" low
- How do we work this from the other end or another angle? (E.g., laws, "Leed certified", expand the niche market, create culture -- e.g., support your local artisan)
- We will have to fight for this: will only happen if we organize grassroots power to open this door & keep it open
- Unions and co-ops are a key part of this (leverage, power)
- Invest wealth into higher wages for what we value & need
