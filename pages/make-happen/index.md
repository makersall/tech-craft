{ NOTE: right now, just a notes dump }

If you like the vision behind Tech Craft, what can you do to turrn it into a reality?

### In Tech
- In tech: push in this direction
- This is also about creating clarity.
- Of going from the fuzzy "I'm going to democratize this technology" to talking much more clearly, okay, how exactly is this going to create more opportunities for folks who don't have a college degree in programming and aren't middle-class white males?
- And also saying much more clearly, we don't need to figure out right now how to scale huge,
but we do need to start at least thinking about that

### In Communities
- Start pushing tech to go in this direction, including experiments on a small scale, and start looking for building coalitions/whatever you would call it in regional communities to see if we can supply more jobs, and four rural areas get big tech companies to start making commitments to do pilot projects to see what's possible that are designed to create real jobs at the end for real small businesses or co-ops at the end.

### State Politicians
So what could a state politician do?

- They can act as a focus, of helping people convene
- and then looking forpots-of-money-to-underwrite the pilot projects that teach us enough to figure out where to go next
- If folks in a non-rural region where there are a bunch of tech jobs that aren't getting filled, could step back and ask, how do we experiment to see what's possible
- The goal isn't to get it right the first time, the goal is to take some steps forward

### Overall 
- In other words, don't pretend we can solve all of this right away.
- This is about creating new models and that means MVP's and iterating


### Potential Targets
- Ironically, one of the best places to start experimenting right now might be in analytics, with data analysts. It's not as sexy as machine learning, but there are a ton of places that still need it and the barriers to entry are smaller




### Miscellaneous
- Not what humans versus computers can do or "high skill" versus "low skill" but more/less common skill
- From cooking shows watched by folks who don't cook to local artisans who have live demo/performances and classes (also for folks who aren't super skilled but are good people)
