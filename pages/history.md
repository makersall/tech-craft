{ NOTE: right now, just a notes dump }

We need to ground this work in the good and bad parts of the history of craft:
- The good: pride in work, control over how you work, pride in community and ownership (we built this country)
- The bad: protecting by excluding others (race, ethnicity, gender, skilled versus unskilled)

And the good and bad parts of the history of changes in jobs:
- What happened to good paying jobs in places like Syracuse vs what happened in Germany
- so: need a voice
- (Silicon Valley and how the right kind of security can build risk-taking and drive innovation)
- But also need to fight for others: the parts of the tradition that see themselves as fighting for the whole community

- Also lied to -- handwaving assurances about this happening
- So: GTS, accountability -- not easy since we don't exactly know what the end result looks like (iterate, MVP
- And: continuing to shape work so that the vague talk about how AI will lead to more creative jobs  actually leads to more creative jobs
