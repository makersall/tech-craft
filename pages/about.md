# Tech Craft

Tech Craft is a project to explore how to transform the tech industry to create
 something like the concept of Blue Color Coding jobs.

 The name Tech Craft is a placeholder; still working on what I'm going to call this project.

Tech Craft is an initiative of [Makers All](https://makersall.org/). The first, quick and dirty version is being created by Anders Schneiderman, Makers All's director.
