# Playful Coding

Playful Coding is a proof of concept source experiment to show how we could teach beginning programming so that:

- We take advantage of the fun, cool stuff tech can do today
- The course and its libraries are open source, so teachers can remix it to fit their students and their teachng style

Playful Coding is based on a mildly simplified library built on top of [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/).

You can also check out the lesson's scripts and the Playful Coding library, which are located at https://makersall.org/playful-coding-scripts/.

*NOTE: this site isn't yet ready for public use -- right now it's just a place to experiment.*
