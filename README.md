# Tech Craft

This repo is a notes dumping ground for a project to explore how to transform the tech industry to create
 something like the concept of Blue Color Coding jobs.

 The name Tech Craft is a placeholder; still working on what I'm going to call this project.

 This project is an initiative of [Makers All](https://makersall.org/).

*NOTE: this site isn't yet ready for public use -- right now it's just a place to experiment.*
